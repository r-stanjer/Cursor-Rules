description: Guidelines for avoiding unnecessary piping to cat with Git commands
globs: 
alwaysApply: false
---
best_practices:
  - "Do not pipe Git command output to cat"
  - "Use Git commands directly without unnecessary pipes"
examples:
  avoid:
    - command: "git log | cat"
      reason: "Unnecessary pipe to cat"
    - command: "git status | cat"
      reason: "Redundant use of cat"
    - command: "git diff | cat"
      reason: "Superfluous pipe operation"
  correct:
    - command: "git log"
      reason: "Direct command output"
    - command: "git status"
      reason: "Clean command usage"
    - command: "git diff"
      reason: "Proper Git command"
rationale:
  - "| cat is redundant and reduces readability"
  - "Git commands are designed to handle output formatting directly"
  - "Adding unnecessary pipes can impact performance"
