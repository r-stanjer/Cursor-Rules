best_practices:
  - "Use gh CLI for GitHub operations instead of web interface or direct Git commands"
  - "Install gh CLI from https://cli.github.com/"
examples:
  repository_management:
    - task: "Creating a repository"
      preferred: "gh repo create"
      instead_of: "Using web interface"
    - task: "Cloning a repository"
      preferred: "gh repo clone"
      instead_of: "git clone"
  pull_requests:
    - task: "Creating a pull request"
      preferred: "gh pr create"
      instead_of: "git push + web UI"
    - task: "Reviewing pull requests"
      preferred: "gh pr list"
      instead_of: "Using web interface"
  issues:
    - task: "Viewing issues"
      preferred: "gh issue list"
      instead_of: "Using web interface"
    - task: "Creating issues"
      preferred: "gh issue create"
      instead_of: "Using web interface"
rationale:
  - "Provides more integrated and streamlined experience for GitHub-specific tasks"
  - "Simplifies scripting and automation of GitHub workflows"
  - "Reduces context switching between terminal and browser"
  - "Enables consistent workflow across different environments"
setup:
  installation:
    url: "https://cli.github.com/"
    authentication: "gh auth login"
